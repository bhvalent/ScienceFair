Science Fair for the Pre-College Programs at the University of Mississippi

The University of Mississippi has a department called Pre-College Programs dedicated to organizing programs and events for students that are not in college yet.  One event that the department puts on is a Science Fair.  The Fair itself is divided into two separate fairs, one for grades 1st thought 6th and another for grades 7th through 12th.  There have been several databases that have been created for the Science Fair but they have either not lasted or are difficult to use.  Even though they have a database to hold all of their data, they do not have a web interface to easily create, read, update, or delete data.  All of the forms are done by hand on paper and then manually entered into the database.  This can be very time consuming because hundreds of students can register for the science fair and there can be fifty to one hundred judges registering as well.  The purpose of this project is to create a database that will hold the information needed in an eloquent and efficient way.  Another purpose is to create a web interface that will allow many of these processes that are done by hand to be automated online.  Like Student and Judge registration. Finally, the last purpose is to allow the Administrators to easily query the data from the database using a web interface.
